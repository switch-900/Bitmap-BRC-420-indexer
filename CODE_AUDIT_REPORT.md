# Code Audit Report - Unused Functions in index-runner.js

## Summary
This audit identifies functions that are declared but never called in the codebase. These functions represent technical debt that can be safely removed to improve code maintainability and reduce file size.

## Unused Functions Identified

### 1. Validation Functions (Unused)
- `validateRoyaltyPayment(deployInscription, mintAddress)` - Line 1095
  - **Status**: Declared but never called
  - **Purpose**: Validates royalty payments for mints
  - **Action**: Can be removed - similar functionality exists in `validateMintRoyaltyPayment`

### 2. Helper Functions (Unused)
- `getBitmapInscriptionId(bitmapNumber)` - Line 1269
  - **Status**: Declared but never called
  - **Purpose**: Retrieves inscription ID for a bitmap number
  - **Action**: Can be removed

- `validateParcelProvenance(parcelInscriptionId, bitmapInscriptionId)` - Line 1283
  - **Status**: Declared but never called
  - **Purpose**: Validates parcel provenance against bitmap
  - **Action**: Can be removed

- `validateParcelNumber(parcelNumber, transactionCount)` - Line 1422
  - **Status**: Declared but never called
  - **Purpose**: Validates parcel numbers
  - **Action**: Can be removed

- `trackInscriptionTransfers(blockHeight)` - Line 1991
  - **Status**: Declared but never called
  - **Purpose**: Tracks inscription transfers (general function)
  - **Action**: Can be removed - `trackKnownInscriptionTransfers` is used instead

### 3. Potentially Unused Functions (Need Investigation)
- `getDeployerAddress(inscriptionId)` - Line 1027
  - **Status**: Declared but appears unused (getDeployerAddressCached is used instead)
  - **Purpose**: Gets deployer address without caching
  - **Action**: Can likely be removed

## Functions That ARE Being Used (Keep)
- `validateDeployerOwnership` - Used in deploy processing
- `validateUniqueDeployment` - Used in deploy processing
- `validateMintRoyaltyPayment` - Used in mint processing
- `validateMintContentType` - Used in mint processing
- `validateMintData` - Used in mint processing
- `getMintAddress` - Used in mint processing
- `convertInscriptionIdToTxId` - Used in validation functions
- `getCurrentMintCount` - Used in mint validation
- `generateBitmapPattern` - Used in bitmap processing
- `getBitmapTransactionHistory` - Used in bitmap pattern generation
- `checkAndUpdateInscriptionOwnership` - Used in transfer tracking
- `trackKnownInscriptionTransfers` - Used in block processing
- `processAndTrackBlock` - Used in main processing loop

## Database Functions (All Used)
All database functions (save*, get*, initialize*) are actively used and should be kept.

## Core Processing Functions (All Used)
All main processing functions (processBlock, processInscription, etc.) are actively used and should be kept.

## Recommended Actions

### High Priority (Safe to Remove)
1. Remove `validateRoyaltyPayment` function
2. Remove `getBitmapInscriptionId` function
3. Remove `validateParcelProvenance` function
4. Remove `validateParcelNumber` function
5. Remove `trackInscriptionTransfers` function

### Medium Priority (Investigate Further)
1. Consider removing `getDeployerAddress` if `getDeployerAddressCached` fully replaces it

## Impact Assessment
- **Lines of code removed**: ~150-200 lines
- **Risk level**: LOW - These functions are not called anywhere
- **Testing required**: Basic functionality testing to ensure no indirect dependencies exist
- **Performance impact**: Minimal positive impact (smaller file size, faster parsing)

## Implementation Plan
1. Create backup of current index-runner.js
2. Remove unused functions in order of safety (highest priority first)
3. Test the indexer startup and basic functionality
4. Monitor for any unexpected errors during runtime
5. Update this report with final results
