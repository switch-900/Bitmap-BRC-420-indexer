# YAML Validation and Installation Test

## ✅ **CRITICAL YAML FIXES APPLIED**

The installation was failing due to **YAML formatting errors** in `docker-compose.yml`. These have now been **completely resolved**:

### **🔧 Issues Fixed:**
1. **Missing newlines** between service sections
2. **Improper indentation** in the web service
3. **Malformed YAML structure** causing parser errors

### **✅ Current Status:**
- ✅ `docker-compose.yml` has **perfect YAML syntax**
- ✅ All service definitions **properly formatted**
- ✅ Environment variables **correctly structured**
- ✅ Ready for **Umbrel installation**

## 🚀 **INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS**

### **1. Update Your App Store**
```bash
cd ~/umbrel/app-stores/bitcoin-indexers-app-store
git pull origin main
```

### **2. Try Installing Again**
```bash
umbrel app install bitcoin-indexers-brc420
```

### **3. If Still Issues, Force Clean Install**
```bash
# Remove any cached data
umbrel app uninstall bitcoin-indexers-brc420
docker system prune -f

# Fresh install
umbrel app install bitcoin-indexers-brc420
```

## 🔍 **What Should Happen Now:**

1. **✅ YAML parsing succeeds** (no more syntax errors)
2. **✅ Docker containers build and start**
3. **✅ Database initializes properly**
4. **✅ Web server starts on port 8080**
5. **✅ Indexer begins processing with external API fallback**

## 📋 **Expected Log Output:**
```
✅ Setting up directory permissions for UID 1000...
✅ Permissions set successfully!
✅ Database setup completed successfully
✅ BRC-420 Indexer web server running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
✅ Starting Bitcoin inscription indexer...
✅ Testing local API connectivity...
✅ Local API not available, using external API: https://ordinals.com/api
✅ Starting to process block 792435
```

## 🎯 **The Fix:**

The root cause was **malformed YAML syntax** where service definitions were incorrectly merged on single lines without proper newlines and indentation. This has been **completely resolved**.

Your app should now **install successfully** without any YAML parsing errors! 🎉
