# üéØ FINAL UMBREL DEPLOYMENT GUIDE

## ‚úÖ WHAT'S BEEN FIXED

We've successfully addressed all the issues preventing the BRC-420 Indexer from running on Umbrel:

### Key Fixes Applied:
1. **‚úÖ Database Initialization**: Moved database setup from separate `db/setup.js` file into `server.js` startup routine
2. **‚úÖ Docker Compose Command**: Fixed command from `sh -c "node db/setup.js && node server.js"` to `["node", "server.js"]`
3. **‚úÖ Standard Umbrel Environment Variables**: Properly configured to use `${APP_BITCOIN_NODE_IP}`, `${APP_ORDINALS_NODE_IP}`, etc.
4. **‚úÖ Single Service Architecture**: Simplified from complex multi-service setup to standard Umbrel single-service pattern
5. **‚úÖ Docker Compose Version**: Changed from 3.8 to 3.7 for Umbrel compatibility

## üöÄ DEPLOY NOW - SIMPLE STEPS

### Step 1: SSH to Your Umbrel
```bash
ssh umbrel@umbrel.local
```

### Step 2: Update and Install
```bash
cd ~/bitcoin-indexers-app-store && git pull origin main && ~/umbrel/scripts/app uninstall bitcoin-indexers-brc420 2>/dev/null; sleep 5 && ~/umbrel/scripts/app install bitcoin-indexers-brc420
```

### Step 3: Verify Installation
```bash
# Check if app is installed
~/umbrel/scripts/app ls-installed | grep bitcoin-indexers-brc420

# Check container status
docker ps | grep bitcoin-indexers-brc420

# View logs
~/umbrel/scripts/app logs bitcoin-indexers-brc420
```

## üìä WHAT TO EXPECT

Once successfully installed, your BRC-420 Indexer will:

1. **Start up cleanly** - No more missing `db/setup.js` errors
2. **Initialize database** - Creates SQLite tables automatically on first run
3. **Connect to local services** - Uses your Umbrel's Bitcoin Core and Ordinals services
4. **Serve web interface** - Available through Umbrel dashboard
5. **Provide REST API** - Full API access for external integrations

## üåê ACCESS YOUR APP

After installation:
- **Umbrel Dashboard**: Look for "Bitcoin Indexers BRC420" in your installed apps
- **Direct Web Access**: The app will be accessible through Umbrel's proxy system
- **API Endpoints**: Available at the app's URL + `/api`

## üìã VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

Run these commands to verify everything is working:

```bash
# 1. Check app is running
docker ps | grep bitcoin-indexers-brc420_web

# 2. Check database was created
ls -la ~/umbrel/app-data/bitcoin-indexers-brc420/data/

# 3. Test health endpoint (from your local machine)
curl http://umbrel.local/[app-path]/health

# 4. Check if indexing is working
~/umbrel/scripts/app logs bitcoin-indexers-brc420 | grep -i "database\|table\|connected"
```

## üîß TROUBLESHOOTING

If you encounter issues:

### Database Problems:
```bash
# Check database file exists and has correct permissions
ls -la ~/umbrel/app-data/bitcoin-indexers-brc420/data/brc420.db
```

### Container Issues:
```bash
# Check container logs for errors
docker logs bitcoin-indexers-brc420_web_1

# Restart the app
~/umbrel/scripts/app restart bitcoin-indexers-brc420
```

### Connectivity Issues:
```bash
# Check if Bitcoin Core and Ordinals are running
docker ps | grep -E "(bitcoin|ord)"

# Verify they're accessible
docker exec bitcoin-indexers-brc420_web_1 curl -s http://ordinals_web_1:4000/api
```

## ‚ú® KEY IMPROVEMENTS MADE

1. **Self-Contained**: Database initialization is now built into the main server process
2. **Umbrel-Native**: Uses all standard Umbrel environment variables and patterns
3. **Simplified Architecture**: Single service instead of complex multi-container setup
4. **Error Recovery**: Better error handling and startup resilience
5. **Standard Compliance**: Follows Umbrel app development best practices

## üéâ SUCCESS INDICATORS

You'll know the app is working when you see:

1. ‚úÖ Container starts without crashing
2. ‚úÖ Database tables are created successfully
3. ‚úÖ Web interface is accessible through Umbrel
4. ‚úÖ API endpoints respond correctly
5. ‚úÖ Logs show successful connection to Bitcoin Core and Ordinals

---

**Your BRC-420 Indexer is now ready to run privately on your Umbrel node!** üéØ

The app will connect to your local Bitcoin Core and Ordinals services, providing completely private inscription indexing without any external dependencies.
