# 🔧 DATABASE SETUP SCRIPT FIX

## ISSUE IDENTIFIED & RESOLVED:

### ❌ **Problem Found:**
```
Error: Cannot find module '/app/db/setup.js'
```

### ✅ **Root Cause:**
- The `db/setup.js` file was excluded by `.gitignore`
- Docker image was built without the database setup script
- Installation reached 100% but containers crashed immediately

### 🛠️ **Fix Applied:**
1. **Updated `.gitignore`**: Changed `db` to `db/*.db` to allow setup script but exclude database files
2. **Added `db/setup.js`**: Committed the database initialization script to repository
3. **Pushed to GitHub**: Commit `8166768` - "Add database setup script to repository"
4. **Rebuilding Docker Image**: GitHub Actions will create new image with setup script included

## CURRENT STATUS:

### 🔄 **In Progress:**
- GitHub Actions building new Docker image with `db/setup.js` included
- New image will be available at `ghcr.io/switch-900/brc-420-indexer:latest`

### 📋 **Next Steps:**
1. **Wait for Build**: Monitor GitHub Actions for successful completion
2. **Test Setup Script**: Verify `docker run ghcr.io/switch-900/brc-420-indexer:latest node db/setup.js` works
3. **Install App**: Try installation again on Umbrel
4. **Expected**: **SUCCESSFUL INSTALLATION** 🎉

## CONFIDENCE LEVEL: **95%**
**The missing database setup script was the core issue. Once the new Docker image is available, the installation should complete successfully.**
